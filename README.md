# Street Light Simulation
This program simulates a street with a traffic light that changes from red to green at set intervals. The program is completely autonomous and does not have a user interface.

## Skills Developed
During the course of this project, I gained valuable experience in:

 - Checking for collisions
 - Randomly generating "cars" when the desired number of cars has been reached

## Compiling and Running the Program
To compile the program with g++, use the following command:

`g++ -o street_light street_light.cpp`

To run the program, use the following command:

`./street_light`

This will compile and run the program, and the simulation will begin.
