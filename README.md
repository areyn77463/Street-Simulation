# Street-Simulation
This project involved creating a simulation of a street with a traffic light that changes from red to green at set intervals. The program is completely autonomous and does not have a user interface.

During the course of this project, I gained valuable experience in:

 - Checking for collisions
 - Randomly generating "cars" when the desired number of cars has been reached
 
These skills will be useful in future projects and will help me to continue growing as a software developer.
